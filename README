-----This is a simple Gateway written in C with Linux's Netfilter mechanism.----
In this gateway, user can achieve  ICMP, FTP and HTTP Packet control.

The ctrl_plane.c is designed for the user to manage the firewall function.
You can just compile it with:
	gcc -O2 -Wall ctrl_plane.c -o ctrl_plane;

The mana_plane.c is used to insert or remove the kerneal module designed for the firewall
to realize some fuctions according to ctrl_plane's order;
You can just compile it with
	gcc -O2 -Wall mana_plane.c -o mana_plane
Pay attention here:
In the mana_plane.c, you need to change the linux kerneal according to your machine.

The contrl plane communicated with the manage plane with tcp socket.
ftp_ctrl.c, http_ctrl.c and icmp_ctrl.c will be compiled by the ctrl_plane and 
then insert into or remove from the Linux Kerneal in dynamic way.
